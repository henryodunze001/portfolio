              I am a developer and product builder based in Lagos, Nigeria. I graduated with a Bsc degree from the Univerisity of Science and Technology, Enugu, Nigeria. I explore the space between web, mobile, and Web3. I enjoy creating simple, useful tools, full-stack apps, and experiments that solve real everyday problems. Constantly learning, shipping, and pushing my craft forward.
